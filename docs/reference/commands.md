# Commands

At the moment, the following commands/statements are supported:

### CREATE [LOCAL|REGIONAL|GLOBAL] TABLE ...

Creates a new table with the specified replication level. The default is `GLOBAL`.

### PRAGMA ATLAS_CONSISTENCY = ...

The `pragma` statement is used to set the consistency level for the following queries. The consistency levels are:

1. `strong`
2. `bounded`
3. `linearizable`
4. `eventual`

Example:

```sql
pragma
atlas_consistency
= strong;
```

Note that any write to the database automatically switches the consistency level to `linearizable`.

### PRAGMA ATLAS_NODE = ID

This outputs the current nodeâ€™s ID or migrates the session to the specified node. This is useful for debugging and
understanding the current state.

Note that session migration may change the current node upon running a query.

### PRAGMA ATLAS_SESSION_MIGRATION = ON|OFF

This enables or disables session migration. By default, session migration is enabled.

### PRAGMA ATLAS_TABLES

This outputs the tables that the current node owns.
